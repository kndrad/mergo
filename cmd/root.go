It processes all non-test Go files in the specified input directory, combining them into a single file per package.
The tool preserves package structure, merges import statements, and maintains all declarations and functions.

Usage:
  mergo -p /path/to/input/directory -o /path/to/output/directory

This will process all Go packages in the input directory and create merged files in the output directory.`,
